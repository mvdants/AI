In this material, you will have introductory algorithms and some more advanced ones, two that I will develop over time.

At this moment, we have a code that is being implemented called "AEstrella". This project is initially being developed to find the fastest route between cities. However, in the future of this project we will have other databases that we could use so that the code can relate better "choices" using the database of difficulties, weights, heuristics, etc.
